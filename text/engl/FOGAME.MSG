|0xff907824 So shorter means better.
|0xff706050 -- scypior

|0xff706050 -- scypior

|0xff706050 -- MrLexx


|0xff907824 Posing gladly, naked for money only.
|0xff706050 -- lisac


|0xff907824 Where there's a hole, there's a way.
|0xff706050 -- Rusty


|0xff907824 Did ya fix the HOLE in da wall, bitch?
|0xff706050 -- Rusty


|0xff907824 Okay, enough radiation for me today,
going back to slave business.
|0xff706050 -- Atom


|0xff907824 Why the fuck are molerats so strong?! I had metal armor
and grease gun, took 3 burst fires to kill one of the
fucks, they raped the shit out of me as if i wasn't
wearing anything at all. Fuck. Those rats are bigger
than fucking bears.
|0xff706050 -- Rusty

|0xff706050 -- scypior


|0xff907824 Some traders in Hub are missing.

|0xff907824 Kidnapped, killed and buried god knows where...

|0xff706050 -- lisac


|0xff907824 Jack is highwayman-spawning machine.
|0xff706050 -- Atom


|0xff907824 I don't like using this brain thing. It's annoying.
|0xff706050 -- MrLexx


|0xff907824 I got small penis too... but i'm THE technician.
Can do things you mortals can only dream of.
|0xff706050 -- lisac


|0xff907824 My team leader is my penis.
|0xff706050 -- Mrlexx


|0xff907824 And my GF interested after your second video -
where from SlimCharles?
|0xff706050 -- LLITiF


|0xff907824 Every girl in russia is dreaming about Lexx.
|0xff706050 -- scypior


|0xff907824 So he won't lose interest, he's strong
third party asses right now.
|0xff706050 -- Atom


|0xff907824 But talking about rape is somewhat boring.
I am not really interested in that.
|0xff706050 -- Mrlexx


|0xff907824 Eventually there will be a 6 hour cybersex with Lynette.
|0xff706050 -- SlimCharles


|0xff907824 Nevertheless, if you're full of beer you
don't mind where you piss at all.
|0xff706050 -- scypior


|0xff907824 Well, but it's simple biology.
You watch hot female, you get a hard one.
|0xff706050 -- Mrlexx


|0xff907824 Damn lesbians, didn't shut the fuck up.
|0xff706050 -- Mrlexx


|0xff907824 I am the kaizer from shaizer.
|0xff706050 -- Mrlexx


|0xff907824 Maybe we should try something similar with fonline.
|0xff706050 -- lisac


|0xff907824 Filming nerdy polaks doesn't sound that good.
|0xff706050 -- Rusty


|0xff907824 Atom you are drunked?
|0xff706050 -- cvet
|0xff907824 Nope, he's retarded.
|0xff706050 -- Rusty


|0xff907824 They should rather learn from Trotsky and make a good
deal of revolution, not this kind of pussy cat fight.
|0xff706050 -- Atom


|0xff907824 Bleh, that quest idea has become shitty now
I need something new, that is at least medium-size.
|0xff706050 -- Mrlexx
|0xff907824 My dick.
|0xff706050 -- Rusty
|0xff907824 That's not a quest, that's a joke.
|0xff706050 -- Mrlexx
|0xff907824 So I've heard.
|0xff706050 -- Rusty


|0xff907824 Scyp's designing hairstyles now.
|0xff706050 -- Solar


|0xff907824 I can't fucking believe it... The Rotators -
The most gay group in the whole universe!
|0xff706050 -- lisac


|0xff907824 He might have become gay too, while being in here.
|0xff706050 -- Ghosthack


|0xff907824 Lexx is a sex slave?
|0xff706050 -- Solar


|0xff907824 Ass too wiry.
|0xff706050 -- cvet


|0xff907824 It was hard for me to remove
"your eyes were poured by a boiling water".
|0xff706050 -- SlimCharles


|0xff907824 I met a russian, he's great. I said 'secret',
he said 'secret anal'.
|0xff706050 -- SlimCharles


|0xff907824 Need big gan. Usa man yel in ncr, his wann
maney bat me keel him and tack his item.
|0xff706050 -- Ghosthack


|0xff907824 Better teach him something that
will make him insult Lexx later.
|0xff706050 -- Atom


|0xff907824 "Russian powergamers" would be great
for a special encounter.
|0xff706050 -- Mrlexx


|0xff907824 Germany's in crysis. Time to start a war.
|0xff706050 -- scypior


|0xff907824 Man, I jammed my balls while walking.
Dunno how, but I can't sit now.
|0xff706050 -- Mrlexx


|0xff907824 It's not a true jrpg, if you don't
have a homo hero to play.
|0xff706050 -- Mrlexx


|0xff907824 Gay dinosaurs, bad idea.
|0xff706050 -- Rusty


|0xff907824 The kids should play with real guns.
|0xff706050 -- Mrlexx


|0xff907824 Fact is that homo can cook, and can cook good. Or its all just a coincidence, or there is a constant that needs deeper research.
|0xff706050 -- Wipe


|0xff907824 I will sacrifice my body to ZAX.
|0xff706050 -- Wipe


|0xff907824 No, its cultural program.
|0xff706050 -- cvet


|0xff907824 I see lisac is almost working.
|0xff706050 -- scypior


|0xff907824 My kitchen looks like ass.
|0xff706050 -- Mrlexx


|0xff907824 I'm already crazy... town_h.fos, enough said.
|0xff706050 -- Ghosthack


|0xff907824 Therefore a little bit oil is enough to get the job done.
|0xff706050 -- MrLexx


|0xff907824 Can be solved by timeout.
|0xff706050 -- Ghosthack


|0xff907824 Why do you complicate my life
|0xff706050 -- scypior
|0xff907824 I love to complicate your life. When i woke up this morning, i thought
"Hm. I should complicate scyps life a bit today"
|0xff706050 -- MrLexx


|0xff907824 I steal from rich devs and give other stuff to poor devs.
I am Robin Hood of coding.
|0xff706050 -- Atom


|0xff907824 What the- I tested it, I swear!
|0xff706050 -- Wipe


|0xff907824 Bots!
|0xff706050 -- Atom
|0xff907824 Perl.
|0xff706050 -- Wipe
|0xff907824 Evil.
What these three words have in common?
|0xff706050 -- Atom
|0xff907824 Where bot is the question, Perl is the answer.
|0xff706050 -- Wipe
|0xff907824 Evil is the result!
|0xff706050 -- MrLexx


|0xff907824 I just want red head girl, damn the lack of progress!
|0xff706050 -- Solar


|0xff907824 It's incredibly stupid, complicated and it doesn't work.
|0xff706050 -- Lisac


|0xff907824 I make more sense than players even when drunk, so it's ok.
|0xff706050 -- Solar


|0xff907824 Ah, Rotators. Music, physics, links to weird porn, bad jokes about jobs
that we have, or don't have, and occasionally some words about FOnline!
|0xff706050 -- Atom


|0xff907824 My bed needs some rage.
|0xff706050 -- Ghosthack
|0xff907824 Was it pick-up line?
|0xff706050 -- Wipe


|0xff907824 I would love to have a black girlfriend. This makes you totally a hipster.
|0xff706050 -- MrLexx


|0xff907824 When something doesn't make sense in FOnline. Just ask yourself:
"Is it a bug?" No...
"Is it a feature?" No...
Then it's prehistoric stuff.
|0xff706050 -- Mayck


|0xff907824 I should proceed with that, as vals hater.
|0xff706050 -- Wipe
|0xff907824 Vals, rats, what else?
|0xff706050 -- Atom
|0xff907824 Beer.
|0xff706050 -- Wipe
|0xff907824 There's a lot of hate inside you. To anger this leads, and anger leads
to the dark side. Can't we just all hate JavaScript? And only that.
I'm joking of course.
Why hate something that is unending source of amusement.
|0xff706050 -- Atom


|0xff907824 Almost any engine problem can be solved by spawning more items.
|0xff706050 -- JovankaB


|0xff907824 Uncrustify destroyed drugs_data.fos, it looks like space invaders now.
