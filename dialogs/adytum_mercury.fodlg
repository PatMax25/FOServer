{2000}{}{Hello! Welcome to Mrs. Mercury's museum! *she points at her own name tag* How can I help you?}
{2010}{}{Museum? What is it about?}
{3000}{}{About... Everything! Our museum is split into 2 parts. In the first one you can check out different pre war relics and in the second one learn a little about the saviors of our city - The Khans!}
{3010}{}{Pre War relics?}
{3020}{}{The Khans?}
{3030}{}{Uh, whatever. I better go find a local bar.}
{4000}{}{Yes, these are taken from all over the Boneyard. Just check it out, it is for free.}
{4010}{}{Sure...}
{4020}{}{I don't give a shit about pre war trash!}
{5000}{}{Yup. These guys saved our city from economic disaster. We had to devote some space in our museum for them.}
{5010}{}{Ain't it a pack of some jet addicted bandits roaming around?}
{5020}{}{Aha... Will take a look.}
{6000}{}{Hey, be more respectful!}
