{100}{}{Zaius}
{200}{}{You see a tough-looking old mutant.}
{210}{}{You see Zaius, the mine foreman.}
{210}{}{On closer examination, you see a tough old mutant with a pickaxe and miner's helmet.}

{2000}{}{You new in town?}
{2010}{}{That's right.}
{2020}{}{Yeah, rolled in a little while back.}
{2030}{}{No, genius, I've been living here all along and you never noticed me.}
{2040}{}{What can you tell me about this place?}
{2050}{}{Yeah, gotta run though. Bye. [ end dialogue ]}
{3000}{}{Right. Well, I'm Zaius. Now that we're introduced... what can I do for you?}
{3010}{}{How are things?}
{3020}{}{You get along all right with the humans?}
{3030}{}{Can you tell me about the town?}
{3040}{}{What is this place, anyway?}
{3050}{}{Nothing, I was just leaving. [ end dialogue ]}
{4000}{}{I'd have to say they're all right. Still... they could always be better.}
{4010}{}{Uh, okay, I had some more questions.}
{4020}{}{Maybe things will look up. See ya. [ end dialogue ]}
{5000}{}{Well, as the mutants are not only getting old and senile -- the gas keeps them young, or something -- I'd have to say things are pretty good. I mean, we don't want to kill everyone, and as far as I can tell, the humans don't think too poorly of us. �Course, that's not including the humans from the other places around here... now those are some bastards.}
{5010}{}{Interesting. Let me ask you something else.}
{5020}{}{Gotta go, bye. [ end dialogue ]}
{6000}{}{Well, the best person to talk to about that would be the Sheriff, over at the bank, or Steve, the greeter for the town.}
{6010}{}{Heh. Thanks for all the information. Few more thanks I wanna ask, though.}

{8000}{}{Ha. Ha. Funny. Nothing better than having a smartass around.}
{8010}{}{I had a couple questions.}
{8020}{}{The main problem here is that you're an idiot.}
{8030}{}{Right. Bye Zaius. [ end dialogue ]}
{9000}{}{The main problem is that I'm an idiot? I'm repeating this because I don't believe that your asshole just spouted something that sounded like words. Get out of my sight, maggot.}
{9010}{}{Fuck you, then. [ end dialogue ]}
{10000}{}{Get out of here, pissant.}
{11000}{}{This place is the Mining Foreman's Office, I manage the activities of our mine from here. Also, this is the only known place where one can buy Uranium ore. If there is another one, we never heard of it.}
{11010}{}{Great, I'd like to buy some Uranium ore. [ Barter ]}
{11020}{}{Sounds like an important place.}
{11030}{}{Right. One more question, please.}
{11040}{}{That's all for now, bye! [ end dialogue ]}
{12000}{}{If it wasn't for that mine out there, there would be no Broken Hills now. Or ever. It keeps the town alive, not sure for how long though.}
{12010}{}{I see. Let's trade now. [ Barter ]}

{12030}{}{That's all for now, bye! [ end dialogue ]}
{13000}{}{We've heard about you and your kind, and we don't want nothing to do with it. You best get your ass out of here.}
{13010}{}{Oh yeah? Maybe I should free the world from your pathetic existence instead. [ Attack ]}
{13020}{}{Fine. [ end dialogue ]}
{14000}{}{You new in town?}
{14010}{}{Eek, oog og!}
{14020}{}{New! Me! Town!}
{15000}{}{Can't understand you, pal. Why not head on down to the saloon? Hell, maybe Francis will
 arm-wrestle with you.}

{16000}{}{Can't you see I'm busy ?}
{17000}{}{Sure, thats what we do. They are $500 each, if you're interested.}
{17010}{}{I'll take a chunk then. [Give him $500]}
{17020}{}{Count me in for 5 chunks.}
{17030}{}{I'll need some more than usually. Give me 20 chunks.}
{17040}{}{Ah, too much for me sorry, I'll come back later. [ end dialogue ]}

{12000}{}{If it wasn't for that mine out there, there would be no Broken Hills now. Or ever. It keeps the town alive, not sure for how long though.}
{12010}{}{I see. Let's trade now.}
{12020}{}{Right. One more question, please.}
{12030}{}{That's all for now, bye!}
{13000}{}{We've heard about you and your kind, and we don't want nothing to do with it. You best get your ass out of here.}
{13010}{}{Oh yeah? Maybe I should free the world from your pathetic existence instead.}
{13020}{}{Fine.}
{14000}{}{You new in town?}
{14010}{}{Eek, oog og!}
{14020}{}{New! Me! Town!}
{15000}{}{Can't understand you, pal. Why not head on down to the saloon? Hell, maybe Francis will
 arm-wrestle with you.}
{15010}{}{Wessle? O-KAY!}
{16000}{}{Can't you see I'm busy ?}
{17000}{}{Sure, thats what we do. They are $500 each, if you're interested.}
{17010}{}{I'll take a chunk then. [Give him $500]}
{17020}{}{Count me in for 5 chunks.}
{17030}{}{I'll need some more than usually. Give me 20 chunks.}
{17040}{}{Ah, too much for me sorry, I'll come back later.}
{18000}{}{Here's your Ore. Come back if you need any more.}
{18010}{}{Yeah, sure.}
