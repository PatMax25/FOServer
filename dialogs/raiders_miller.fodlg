{200}{}{You see Miller, the Khan quartermaster.}
{210}{}{You see the Khan quartermaster. He looks like the only guy in the room who knows what that word means.}

{2010}{}{Can I ask you something?}

{4000}{}{There's been raiders ever since the bombs dropped. Shit like that happens when every policeman within a thousand miles is dead all of a sudden. This outfit's fairly old, but we didn't hit the big time until we found these caves. It's a great spot - hard to find, harder to attack, and right in the middle of a bunch of juicy targets. We've got no truck with fancy ideologies, dreams of the future, order in the wastes, any of that shit. Why work hard for scraps when you can get the best for nothin? What sets us apart from any shithead who grabs a gun and points it at someone? Brains, motherfucker.  We got some smart assholes in this crew - guys who know how to run shit, how to get things done. This outfit's on the up, and I've got myself a sweet cut of the action.}
{4010}{}{I see. Can I ask something else?}
{4020}{}{Thanks. I'll be back later. [ end dialogue ]}
{5000}{}{I'm the quartermaster. Fancy name for not a very fancy job. Turns out I know more about gear than anyone else here, so they put me in charge of it. Basically I keep track of how we are for food, water, ammunition, weaponry, armour, smokes, booze, jet, pornos...everything that the boys use.}
